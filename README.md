# Python_Game_GuessANumber
Python Fundamentals Practical project

This project involves a console game named "Guess a Number"
"Guess A Number" is a game in which your opponent is "the computer", who chooses a random number between "1 and 100", and the player's task is to guess that number. After each number entered by the player, the computer will give a hint as to whether the number is greater or less than the selected number until the correct number is guessed.
